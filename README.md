# RoNew

In a single click, join the newest server of any Roblox experience!

This extension allows you to automatically join the newest server of a Roblox experience, by waiting for the new server to show up.

# Usage

1. Navigate to a roblox.com page
2. Open the extension
3. Enter the place id (or have it auto-filled from a game page)
4. Click "Join Newest"

Note that it may take a while on certain games, as Roblox can stop creating new servers periodically.
